# Sider Lua modules for Master League

Modules for the Sider that ships in `pes.7z` (`sider.dll` of 20 February 2022, Lua
enabled in `sider.ini`). They work on the running game; `PES2017.exe` is not edited.

| file | what it does |
|---|---|
| `MLCheck.lua` | **read-only test.** Reads the overall window of computer clubs by level (section 9.4 of `../MASTER_LEAGUE.md`) and four numbers of the transfer fee formula (section 6.2) from the running game and writes them to `sider.log`. It writes nothing to the game |
| `test_module.py <PES2017.exe>` | runs `MLCheck.lua` outside the game against the bytes of the exe file (needs `pip install lupa`) |
| `MLMoney.lua` | **changes the game.** Player values by rating, age, position and popularity, salaries by rating and age, and the transfer budget of a new career, from tables at the top of the file. Checks the game's code first and writes nothing if it differs. Not yet run in the game |
| `money_cave.py` | what `MLMoney.lua` writes (four small routines, with their source) and the same arithmetic as Python |
| `test_money.py <PES2017.exe>` | runs `MLMoney.lua` on the exe in the emulator, then runs the game's salary, fee and budget code with the changes in and compares it with `money_cave.py` (needs `pip install lupa unicorn`) |

## Install and run `MLCheck.lua`

1. Copy `MLCheck.lua` into the `modules` folder next to `sider.exe`.
2. Add this line to `sider.ini`, below the other `lua.module` lines:
   `lua.module = "MLCheck.lua"`
3. Start the game with Sider as usual, wait for the title screen, quit.
4. Open `sider.log` (next to `sider.exe`) and look for the lines with `MLCheck`.

Expected, on the exe of this repository:

```
MLCheck 1: read-only test, nothing is written to the game
club level       0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
lowest overall  47 51 55 59 63 67 70 73 76 83   as expected
highest overall 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 83 86 99   as expected
fee: rating step 68             at 038ab8db = 83f844   as expected
fee: 9,000 per rating point     at 038ab8e6 = 69ff28230000   as expected
fee: factor 0.00027             at 0216ba48 = 00000020d9b1313f   as expected
fee: factor 2.2                 at 01f0f2b8 = 000000a099990140   as expected
RESULT: 6 of 6 as expected. The running game has the code the notes describe, at the same addresses.
```

To remove it, delete the line from `sider.ini`.

What the result means:

- **6 of 6**: the running game holds the same code at the same addresses as the exe
  file that was analysed. A module that changes these numbers can be tried next.
- **`DIFFERENT` or `??`**: the game that runs is not this exe, or its code is changed
  in memory. No tuning module made from these notes should be used.
- **No `MLCheck` line at all**: look for `MLCheck.lua` in `sider.log`. Sider writes
  there why it skipped the module (file not found, error in `init`).

## Result in the game (14 November 2026)

`MLCheck.lua` ran on the user's PC under Sider 3.6.0: **6 of 6 as expected**, with the
same nine lines as above. So the running game holds the analysed code at the analysed
addresses, and a Sider module reads it without trouble.

What else the same `sider.log` shows:

- `luajit.ext.enabled = 0`: modules have no `ffi`, `bit` or `require`. Modules here must
  not need them.
- Sider itself uses `0x026503E0` (`_tid_addr1`), the pointer `MASTER_LEAGUE.md` calls the
  mode object, and `0x04062701`, the competition id table function. Two addresses of the
  notes confirmed from another side.
- Sider changes code at 31 places of the running game (hooks and small patches). None of
  them lies in one of the 133 functions that `../names.tsv` named when this was checked,
  so the salary, fee, fixture and computer-club code runs as analysed. The eight names
  added later (prize money, account lines) were not checked against the 31 places, and
  the 31 addresses are not kept here. `MLMoney.lua` settles it at run time: it compares
  every piece of code it relies on with the exe file before it writes, so a place Sider
  had changed would show as `DIFFERENT` and nothing would be written.
- Sider's gameplay settings point at the constants `0x01F0F2A8` and `0x01F0F2C0`, the
  neighbours of the shared 2.2 at `0x01f0f2b8`. One more reason not to change that
  constant in place.
- Three other modules of that install are not active, for reasons of their own:
  `Script_Stadiums.lua` (file `map_teams.txt` missing), `PlayerDump.lua` (calls
  `memory.search_process`, which this Sider does not have) and `GrowthBridge.lua` (asks
  for events this Sider does not know: `key_down`, `overlay_on`, `set_teams`,
  `gamepad_input`).

## `MLMoney.lua`, version 3: values, salaries, budgets and prize money

### What the game does without it

`../MASTER_LEAGUE.md` section 6. The value of a player is
`salary x (2.2 to 3.3) + 9,000 x (rating - 68)`, and the screens show 100 times the
stored amount. There is no age and no position in it, and it rises in a straight line
with the rating. From the formula, for a club high in the ranking: rating 80 about 16
million, 85 about 23 million, 94 about 40 million. The one player measured in the user's
career, Bruno Fernandes (rating 89, captain's bonus in his salary), showed 36,743,200.

When a career starts, the transfer budget of the user's club is twice the mean value of
its 16 best players, and the salary budget is the wage bill plus twice the mean salary
of its 16 best paid players (section 6.4).

A cup pays once, when the club is out or has won: 8 million for winning the Champions
League, half a million for going out in its group stage. A first division pays 15
million for place 1 down to 0.3 million. The money goes to the club's balance; neither
budget gets any of it (section 6.7). The first club of the game's club ranking pays twice
the salary of a club outside the first 250. A player of 23 or younger signs for 3 years
at most (section 7.3).

### What the module does

- **Value** = `VALUE[rating] x AGE[age] x POSITION[registered position]`, times the
  player's own fixed factor (`SPREAD`), plus `FAME` percent of that for every 1,000
  popularity points of the player (section 6.5). The salary no longer enters the value.
  The rest of the game's fee function is untouched: figures handed in by a deal, the
  random change of up to 20 or 49 percent, the limit.
- **The player's own factor**: without it, two players of the same rating, age and
  position cost exactly the same. Each player gets one of 256 steps between
  `100 - SPREAD` and `100 + SPREAD` percent, chosen by his id, so it is the same every
  time the game asks.
- **Salary**: the rating part (`30 x rating - 500` plus the steps at 65, 75, 85) becomes
  `SALARY[rating] x SALARY_AGE[age]`. The popularity part is the game's own.
- **Transfer budget** at the start of a career: `BUDGET_TRANSFER` times the mean value
  of the 16 best players, in place of 2 times. `BUDGET_SALARY` does the same for the
  salary budget and is off by default.

New in version 3, each with its own switch:

- **Cup prizes** (`CUP`): the amounts of the game's cup table are replaced for the
  competitions and stages named in the setting. The game's table is not written; the
  three instructions that read it are pointed to a copy.
- **League prizes** (`LEAGUE`, `LEAGUE_2`): the game's two main lists by place, for
  first and second divisions. Leagues played in two halves still get half per half.
- **Prizes into the transfer budget** (`PRIZE_TO_BUDGET`): on the day a prize is paid,
  that percent of it is added to the transfer budget as well. The balance gets the whole
  prize as before. Only in Master League (game mode `0x13`).
- **Pay gap** (`PAY_GAP`): the first club of the ranking pays this many times the
  salary of a club outside the first 250, in place of 2 times. `SALARY` is what the
  first club pays, so a higher gap lowers the salaries at small clubs.
- **Salary bonuses** (`BONUS`): the game's bonuses for the team role, the age band and
  the awards are multiplied by this percent. They are fixed amounts (1,000 to 15,000 a
  year stored, 100,000 to 1.5 million on the screen) that the larger salaries of the
  module would otherwise dwarf.
- **Contract years** (`YOUNG_YEARS`): the limit of 3 years for a player of 23 or
  younger becomes this number. The game still picks the years itself below the limit
  (section 7.3), so not every young player is offered the full length.

Not changed: the second salary formula (`fcn_038ab5ea`, used for clubs of the league
numbers 60 to 62 and for some players in one mode), the yearly income of the club and
the yearly budget step (section 6.7), the prizes of the national cups and super cups,
the lists of the league numbers 60 and 61, the cup table of game mode `0x28`, the choice
of players by the computer clubs (it never looked at money).

### Settings (top of the file; amounts in millions as on the screen)

| `BUDGET_TRANSFER` | 3 (the game: 2); `false` leaves the game's code |
| `BUDGET_SALARY` | `false` = the game's own 2 |
| `CUP` (competition, stage, millions) | Champions League (2): winner 82.12, runner-up 75.62, semi-final 57.12, quarter-final 42.12, first knock-out round 29.62, group stage 18.62. Europa League (3): 26.06, 20.06, 13.06, 8.86, round of 16 6.36, first knock-out round 4.61, group 4.31. UEFA Super Cup (4): 5 and 4. Libertadores (5): 32.25, 15.25, 8.25, 5.95, 4.25, 3. Sudamericana (6): 9.5, 5, 3, 2.2, 1.5, 0.9. AFC Champions League (8): 12, 6, 2, 1.4, 1, 0.8. Club World Cup (1): 5 and 4. `false` leaves the game's amounts |

Where the prize defaults come from. Cups: the fixed payments per stage of 2025/26
(Champions League, Europa League, UEFA Super Cup), of 2025 (Libertadores, Sudamericana,
Intercontinental Cup for the Club World Cup) and of 2024/25 (AFC Champions League), as
published in the press, added up to the stage where the run ends, because the game pays
a cup once. The payments per win and the television shares are not in them; with those
a Champions League winner got about 140 million in 2024/25, so the defaults are on the
low side for the big cups. Euros and dollars are taken as the same. League: the Premier
League's payments by place of 2024/25 (pounds), used for every first division because
the game has one list for all of them; the equal share every club gets is not in it.
There is no default for second divisions: no figures were looked up.

The competition numbers 1 and 5 match names of the edit file. The numbers 2, 3, 4, 6
and 8 are **inferred** from the shape of the game's table (which stages have a prize),
and so are the stage names. If one of them is another competition, that one gets the
amounts meant for the first. `python3 ../tools/prize.py <exe>` prints the game's table.

The defaults were set by hand against published figures of 2026: the most valuable
players at 200 to 220 million, the 25th at 100 million; Bruno Fernandes at about 42
million and 300,000 pounds a week; Manchester United's summer of 145 million pounds
spent and 99 million net. They are a starting point, not a fit to a data set.

What the defaults give for the players and squads of the edit file in this repository
(worked with `money_cave.py`, `SPREAD` left out, every club taken with club part 300 of
the popularity; not read from a career):

| | |
|---|---|
| most valuable | Lamine Yamal 238 million, Erling Haaland 204, Jude Bellingham 193, Michael Olise 183, Kylian Mbappé 183, Pedri 175, Vitinha 167 |
| 25th, 50th, 100th, 200th player | 93, 70, 51, 33 million |
| transfer budget | Manchester United 107 million (72 with the factor 2, 39 with the game's own formulas), Manchester City 208, Real Madrid 232, Paris Saint-Germain 254, Liverpool 147, Juventus 88, Brentford 59, Sevilla 29, Burnley 19 |

### Install

1. Copy `MLMoney.lua` into the `modules` folder next to `sider.exe`, over version 2.
2. `sider.ini` needs the line `lua.module = "MLMoney.lua"` (once).
3. Start the game. `sider.log` must show seventeen `check:` lines "as expected", the
   line "free memory ... empty", thirteen `written:` lines "ok", the tables, and
   `RESULT: installed. Changed: values, salaries, transfer budget, cup prizes, league
   prizes, prizes into the transfer budget, pay gap, salary bonuses, contract years.`

To undo: remove the line from `sider.ini`. No file of the game is changed.

**A running career.** Salaries are stored in the contracts and the budgets were made
from the old numbers. With the module on, values change at once, salaries only at a new
contract, and the budgets stay as they are. Prizes, the share for the transfer budget
and the contract limit work in a running career from the day the module is on. For a
running career set `SALARY = false`, `PAY_GAP = false` and `BONUS = false`, or start a
new career.

### Version 2 in the game (November 2026)

The user ran version 2 with `SPREAD = 0`: all checks "as expected", three places
written, `RESULT: installed. Changed: values, salaries, transfer budget.` In a new
career with Manchester United:

- Bruno Fernandes (rating 89, AMF, age 32) showed a value of **52,973,200**. The
  module's formula gives exactly that for popularity 910, and for no other popularity
  from 0 to 3,000 (`test_money.py`, ok 5). In the older career his popularity was 955,
  which would give 53,191,700; a new career starts him lower.
- The transfer budget was **106,925,700**. The estimate made from the edit file, with
  every player's popularity guessed, was 107 million.

So the value routine runs in the game and reads rating, age, position and popularity
from the right places, the budget routine runs, and the budget field is the one the
screen shows. Not seen yet: salaries of new contracts, `SPREAD` above 0, a season.

### What to look at with version 3

Nothing of the five new parts has run in the game. In the order of effort:

1. `sider.log` as under Install. If a `check:` line says `DIFFERENT`, nothing is written;
   send the log.
2. A new career with the same club must start with the same transfer budget as with
   version 2 (Manchester United: 106,925,700 with the same edit file), because the
   values are unchanged. This shows that the larger module did not disturb the old part.
3. Note the salary of two players in the new career, with their rating, age and team
   role: one star and one captain or leader. From these the pay gap and the bonus can
   be checked against `money_cave.py`.
4. Offer a new contract to a player of 23 or younger. Lengths of 4 or 5 years must now
   be possible; the game never offered more than 3 before.
5. Note the transfer budget on the day before and the day after your club goes out of
   a cup or wins one, and at the end of the league. It must rise by 75 percent of the
   prize. For the league: place 1 = 53,100,000, so 39,825,000 more budget. A national
   cup keeps the game's amounts (winner 2,000,000, so 1,500,000 more budget).

### How it works

Up to fifteen places of the game's code are changed and a piece of unused memory is
filled (`money_cave.py` has the layout and the source of the seven routines):

| where | before | after | setting |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x038ab8db`, 17 bytes, fee function | `9,000 x max(0, rating - 68)` into `edi` | call to the value routine; it also sets the factor of the salary part to 0 | always |
| `0x038ac875`, 7 bytes, salary function | start of the 98 bytes that compute the rating part | call to the salary routine, jump over the rest | `SALARY` |
| `0x038adc47`, 5 bytes, budget function | the mean value of the best 16, doubled | call to a routine that multiplies by `BUDGET_TRANSFER` | `BUDGET_TRANSFER` |
| `0x038add08`, 8 bytes, budget function | wage bill + twice the mean salary of the best 16 | call to a routine that uses `BUDGET_SALARY` in place of the 2 | `BUDGET_SALARY` |
| `0x038aa400`, `0x038aa408`, `0x038aa423`, 4 bytes each, `cup_prize` | address of the game's cup table (`0x0216b178`) in three instructions | address of the module's copy of the table | `CUP` |
| `0x038aa2dd`, 7 bytes, `league_prize` | `mov eax, [ebp + eax*4 - 0x17c]`: the first list, built on the stack | `mov eax, [eax*4 + the module's list]` | `LEAGUE` |
| `0x038aa2c6`, 7 bytes, `league_prize` | the same for the second list | the same | `LEAGUE_2` |
| `0x03640ac5` and `0x03640b78`, 5 bytes each, `prize_step` | `call balance_add` for a league and for a cup prize | call to a routine that calls `balance_add` and then, in Master League, `transfer_budget_add` with the share | `PRIZE_TO_BUDGET` |
| `0x038aca1b`, 4 bytes, salary function | address of the shared 0.004 in `fmul qword [0x01f2fe88]` | address of a number of the module, `(PAY_GAP - 1) / 250` | `PAY_GAP` |
| `0x038aca2b`, 6 bytes, salary function | `add esi, [ebp - 0x50]`: role bonus + popularity part | call to a routine that first multiplies the role bonus by `BONUS` | `BONUS` |
| `0x038acd96`, 12 bytes, salary function | award bonuses + band bonus into `eax` | call to a routine that multiplies their sum by `BONUS` | `BONUS` |
| `0x03887fc1`, 5 bytes, contract limit | `mov eax, 3` | `mov eax, YOUNG_YEARS` | `YOUNG_YEARS` |
| `0x047b0200`, 2,704 bytes | zero | the tables, the cup table, two league lists, nine numbers, seven routines of 165, 53, 26, 22, 53, 24 and 21 bytes | always |

The memory is the end of the code section `.trace`: its content ends at `0x047b005d` and
its last page runs to `0x047b0fff`. The section is readable, writable and executable in
the exe's header, so the routines can run there whatever Sider does with the page
protection. No call or jump of the exe goes into that range. For the changed places a
scan of the exe found no call or jump into the inside of any of them; for the three
address operands in `cup_prize` this was read from the listing of the function, not
scanned.

No shared constant is changed: the 0.004 of the club factor has five other users in the
exe, so the salary function is given a number of its own.

What the routines read of a player record: the age (6 bits at `+0x1c`, bit 7) and the
registered position (4 bits at `+0x04`, bit 28), which is where the game's own getter
`fcn_038278b0` reads fields `0x2b` and `0x00`; the popularity (`+0xb4`, bit 11) as the
fee function itself does; the id (`+0x2c`, `+0x30`) as the rating function does.

Order of the module's work: check the settings; build the tables; compare 4,769 bytes
of the game, in seventeen pieces, with what the exe file has (the code around every
changed place, whole functions where they are short: `cup_prize`, `league_prize`,
`balance_add`, `transfer_budget_add`, the contract limit; the game's cup table); see
that the memory is all zero; write tables and routines; read them back; only then
change the places one by one and read each back. If a comparison fails, nothing more is
written. The part of `MLMoney.lua` that holds the routines, the places and the compared
bytes is made by `python3 money_cave.py lua <exe>`; the test fails if the two differ.

### What the test shows

```
python3 test_money.py ~/pes-work/game/PES2017.exe
ok 0: without the module the emulated game gives the amounts of ../tools/money.py (salary with role, age band and award bonuses at every place of the club ranking; fee); its budget function adds twice the mean of the 16 highest fees and the wage bill plus twice the mean of the 16 highest salaries; cup_prize and league_prize give the game's lists (2626 and 3136 cases); a prize goes to the balance only; the contract limit is 3 years up to age 23
ok 1: the module passes its checks, writes only its memory and the places it reports, and what it wrote is what money_cave.py builds from the same settings
ok 2: with the changes in, the game's code gives the amounts of money_cave.py: salary and fee for 3000 + 3000 random players (ratings 40 to 255, ages 0 to 63, every position, with and without awards and the random change) and for every place of the club ranking; the budgets of 150 squads of 0 to 40 players; cup_prize for 2626 cases (competitions 0 to 100, stages 0 to 12, two game modes; mode 0x28 keeps its own table); league_prize for 3136 cases (every list, place and half); the two places that pay a prize, in Master League and four other modes: balance, transfer budget, account line, registers and stack; the two bonus routines leave every other register as it was; the contract limit for every age
ok 3: with every optional part switched off only the fee place is written and salary, prizes and contract limit are the game's own; each of the 10 optional parts switched on alone changes its own places and nothing else; BUDGET_SALARY changes the salary budget; with spread, position and salary age switched off the value is VALUE x AGE plus popularity; PAY_GAP = 1, 1.5, 2, 2.75, 7.3, 10 give the club factor of money_cave.py at every place of the ranking; with every setting at its limit the code and money_cave.py still agree
ok 4: WRITE = false, one changed byte at 51 places of the checked code and data, memory not empty, 30 kinds of faulty settings: nothing is written; a write that does not stick: the code is not touched
ok 5: Bruno Fernandes as the user saw him without a module (rating 89, salary 7,259,700, value 36,743,200): the game's formula gives exactly that value from that salary with popularity 955, and with no other rating from 60 to 99
      as the user saw him with version 2 and SPREAD = 0 in a new career (age 32, value 52,973,200): the module's formula gives exactly that for an AMF of rating 89 with popularity 910, and with no other popularity
```

About 25 seconds. The prize, budget and salary code of the game runs as machine code in
the emulator, with the module's changes in it. For the two places that pay a prize the
piece of `prize_step` around each call is run on its own, with a made-up stack frame;
`prize_step` as a whole (the walk over the competitions of the club) was not run.

The test was tried against planted faults. Version 2: ten in the routines and the
changed places (wrong shift for the position, wrong mask for the age, the id read with
its unused upper half, wrong table for the salary age, wrong step of the spread, wrong
divisor of the popularity bonus, wrong number slot or wrong sum in the budget routines,
a call one byte off). Nine made it fail. The tenth, leaving out the `test esi, esi` at
the end of the transfer budget routine, cannot be seen in the emulator: the jump after
it reads the zero flag, which a real processor leaves undefined after a division and
the emulator does not. The instruction is there for the real processor.

Version 3: twenty more (the prize routine without the mode test, with the stack off by
4, with an unsigned division, without the call to `balance_add`; the bonus routines
without the popularity part, without the awards, with a register not restored; the two
league lists swapped; a cup operand pointing to the stage column; the pay gap operand
one byte off; the contract limit written to the wrong instruction; two faults in
`money_cave.py`'s own arithmetic; six in the Lua: a cup amount in the wrong row, a
wrongly built floating-point number, league places shifted, the contract years setting
ignored, a place written although switched off, one piece of code not compared). All
twenty made it fail; two of them (a register not restored in a bonus routine) only
after a check of the routines' registers was added, because the game does not use
those registers afterwards.

Not shown by the test: Sider's `memory.write` on the real game, the memory being empty
in the running game (the module checks it), that the game's cup table and code are in
the running game as in the exe file (the module checks it), which competition each
number of the cup table is, when and how often the game calls the prize code in a
season, what the screens show of a prize, and the play of a season with the new
numbers. The 30 June budget step grades the year's result against the year before
(section 6.7); larger prizes enter that result, and what this does over several seasons
is not known. The yearly income of a club is not scaled; read from the code it is about
50 to 200 million a year by ranking place (section 6.4), which should carry the new
salaries, but no season was played. The emulator computes the club factor with 80-bit
floating point; if the game runs with a lower precision setting, a salary can differ by
1 (100 on the screen).

## What was looked at in `sider.dll`

Read from the DLL's code and strings, not run:

- A module must return a table with an `init(ctx)` function. It gets these names:
  `log`, `memory` (`read`, `write`, `search`, `pack`, `unpack`), `string`, `table`,
  `math`, `pairs`, `ipairs`, `tostring`, `tonumber`, `type`, `unpack`, `assert`,
  `error`, `os` (`time`, `clock`, `date`), `audio`; with `luajit.ext.enabled` also
  `ffi`, `bit`, `require`. There is **no `pcall`**: an error in `init` makes Sider skip
  the module and log the error.
- `memory.read(address, count)` makes the pages readable and writable
  (`VirtualProtect`), copies the bytes, and asks for the old protection back with a
  call that Windows refuses (no place for the old value is passed). So **a read leaves
  the touched pages marked writable**. No byte changes. Every Sider module that reads
  memory does the same.
- `memory.write(address, bytes)` does the same and copies the other way, so it can
  change code. That is the route for the tuning modules. It gives the pages the
  protection "read, write, execute" (`0x40`) before the copy; if Windows refuses that,
  the module stops with an error and Sider skips it.

## Notes for the next module

- The exe has a fixed load address (no relocation table, no dynamic base), so the
  addresses of `MASTER_LEAGUE.md` are valid in the running game. `MLCheck.lua` tests
  exactly this.
- The level values are single bytes inside `mov eax, value` instructions; 68 and 9,000
  of the fee formula are numbers inside two instructions; 0.00027 is a constant with
  one user. All four can be changed in place.
- **The 2.2 of the fee formula is a shared constant** (`0x01f0f2b8`, 16 references in
  the exe). It must not be changed in place; the fee function has to be pointed to a
  constant of its own. (`MLMoney.lua` does not need it: its routine sets the factor of
  the salary part to 0 in the function's own stack frame.)
- Free memory for code and tables: `0x047b0200`-`0x047b0fff`, the end of `.trace`
  (3,584 bytes; `MLMoney.lua` uses the first 1,472). A module must see zeros there
  before it writes.
